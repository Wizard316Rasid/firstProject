    <p>On this page we show you how to step by step learn the backflip,
    this lesson will be in video form on YouTube but we will be making a newer updated version of the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBSl55l9agxa ">video</a> because this was recorded 2 years ago.
    Now, I know that the video is more than 11 minutes long, and the title says "under 5 minutes" but there are a few things that should be
    taken into consideration. First of all, we do talk <span style="color:#a80000"> A LOT </span> in the video witch takes up a bunch of the time,
    and we are kids, you can't expect us to be perfect and exact!<div id="div"> Now that we cleared that out of the way,
    I can give you links for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV4_8rg2aeIRkRf-dzT1eBA">channel</a>
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBBSl55l9agxa ">video</a>. Make shore to check out the rest of
    the channel.</div>

  <p>
  I know the video doesn't explain it well, but first you start with a sideways gainer, putting one foot on the mattres depending on if youre a righty or a lefty. If you are a lefty you will aproach
  the mattres from the left, and jump with youre left foot throwing yourself backwards or over the shoulder and landing on your stomach, for righties it is the same thing but on your right. When
  you feel comfortable you can start jumping more over your back, until you get to fully going on your back.<p> When you feel comfortable, and this is very important not to rush because this is a very
  dangerous move, you will start jumping whith both legs on to the mattres, and if you need
  to you can wait a few seconds to then jump over youre side until you get brave enough to stop jumping over youre side and jump backwards. Later you will start not having a run up and start jumping
  just of the mattres, if you want yo can jump sideways at first and then start jumping over you back onto youre stomach. After a while you can start jumping on to youre knees and than on youre feet.</p>
